This is a chord progression generator desgnined for musicians who are looking for inspiration for their next song or just want to mess around with different progressions. This application is perfect for when you're jamming with a couple of friends over a progression, to aiding in your songwriting efforts!

Personally, as a guitarist I know that music theory is very important in creating music. With this application generating the chords in the respective key it won't just help you create consice music it will give you more of an understanding of how the theory behing it works. 

Make sure the code generator works I needed to create an Array of all the Major and Minor keys in the musical alphabet. Then create a function that would generate a random tonic chord (the I-Chord). Then make sure that the rest of the chords generated would be in the key of the tonic. I.E if the chosen tonic was C major then the generated chords would have to be 4 of the following: C,Dm,Em,F,G,Am,Bdim. (The Key of C major).
